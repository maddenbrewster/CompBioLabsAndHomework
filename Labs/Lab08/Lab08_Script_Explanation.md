## Function Name: _log_growth_model_
### Description: Creates a logistic growth model for abundance population by taking the arguments:   
> * **r** (intrinsic growth rate)
> * **K** (the carrying capacity)
> * The total number of **generations**
> * The **initial population** size
### and returns a 2 column matrix with generations in the first column and population abundance in the second column.  


## Other script capabilities:  
> * Plots the time vs. population abundance 

> Sample plot: [Logistic Growth Model Sample Plot][log_growth_plot.jpg]


> * Writes the 2 column matrix to a .csv file  

## Specific data included in this script:  
> * r = 0.8
> * K = 10000
> * generations = 12 
> * initial population = 2500
